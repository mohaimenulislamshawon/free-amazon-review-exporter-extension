- **Content Script**:  
  The `content.js` script scans the Amazon product page for review texts using the `data-hook="review-body"` attribute.

- **Background Script**:  
  The `background.js` script manages the storage of reviews and ensures no duplicates are saved.

- **Popup Interface**:  
  The `popup.html` and `popup.js` files provide a user-friendly interface to view and copy the reviews.
