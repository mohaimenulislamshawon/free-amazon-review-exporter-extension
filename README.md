### How It Works

- **Content Script**:  
  The `content.js` script scans the Amazon product page for review texts using the `data-hook="review-body"` attribute.

- **Background Script**:  
  The `background.js` script manages the storage of reviews and ensures no duplicates are saved.

- **Popup Interface**:  
  The `popup.html` and `popup.js` files provide a user-friendly interface to view and copy the reviews.

### **Known Limitations and Areas for Improvement**

While this extension is functional and provides a solid foundation for scraping Amazon reviews, there are several areas where it can be improved. Contributions are highly encouraged to address these limitations and make the extension even more powerful and user-friendly.

#### 1. **Pagination Support**
   - **Problem**: Currently, the extension only scrapes reviews from the current page. If a product has multiple pages of reviews (e.g., 10 reviews per page), the extension does not automatically navigate to subsequent pages to collect all reviews.
   - **Solution Needed**: Implement pagination handling to scrape reviews from all pages associated with a product. This could involve simulating clicks on "Next" buttons or programmatically fetching URLs for additional review pages.

#### 2. **Video Reviews**
   - **Problem**: The extension cannot extract reviews that are attached to videos. These reviews often contain valuable insights but are currently ignored due to their unique structure.
   - **Solution Needed**: Add support for identifying and extracting text from video reviews. This may involve detecting video elements and associating them with their corresponding review text.

#### 3. **Persistent Storage**
   - **Problem**: The extension currently relies on Chrome's local storage, which is limited in capacity and tied to the browser. There is no external database or cloud-based storage for long-term persistence or sharing of scraped data.
   - **Solution Needed**: Introduce an option to export reviews to external databases (e.g., Firebase, MongoDB) or downloadable files (e.g., CSV, JSON). Alternatively, allow users to sync data across devices using cloud storage.

#### 4. **Direct Review Extraction from Product Pages**
   - **Problem**: Users must navigate to the dedicated reviews page to extract reviews. This adds an extra step, as the extension cannot directly fetch reviews from the product page URL.
   - **Solution Needed**: Enhance the extension to extract reviews directly from the product page URL, eliminating the need for users to manually navigate to the reviews section.

#### 5. **Filtering Options**
   - **Problem**: The extension lacks filtering options for reviews based on star ratings (e.g., show only 5-star or 1-star reviews) or other criteria such as date, helpfulness, or verified purchases.
   - **Solution Needed**: Add filtering functionality to allow users to selectively extract reviews based on specific criteria. For example:
     - Filter by star rating (e.g., only 4-star and above).
     - Filter by date range (e.g., reviews from the last 6 months).
     - Filter by verified purchase status.

#### 6. **Batch Processing for Multiple Products**
   - **Problem**: The extension currently works on a single product page at a time. Users cannot batch-process multiple products to extract reviews in one go.
   - **Solution Needed**: Implement a feature to accept a list of product URLs and scrape reviews for all products in the list. This would be particularly useful for users analyzing multiple products.

#### 7. **Error Handling and Edge Cases**
   - **Problem**: The extension may fail to handle certain edge cases, such as dynamically loaded content, CAPTCHA pages, or changes in Amazon's HTML structure.
   - **Solution Needed**: Improve error handling and robustness to ensure the extension works reliably across different scenarios. For example:
     - Detect and retry failed scrapes.
     - Handle dynamic content loading using techniques like waiting for elements to appear.
